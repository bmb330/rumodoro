#Rumodoro
##A command line Pomodoro written in Ruby

This is a really simple Pomodoro timer that can be run from the command line.
Rumodoro was thrown together one evening to further my Ruby knowledge and play around.
I may do some additional things with it later on. If anyone has suggestions, please let
me know.

###Usage:
Simply run `rumodoro.rb` to start the timer for 25 minutes.
Run `rumodoro.rb n` where n is any number value to start the timer for n minutes.

###Audio:
Rumodoro uses the 'sox' package to play the audio bell. Verify sox is installed.
